# RandomCFGDerivator
A project for Theory of Computability class that takes a context free grammar file and derives a random correct string.

Included files:
grammar.py - python3 source containing the grammar class,
variable.py - python3 source containing the variable class,
variable_reference.py - python3 source containing the variable reference class,
random_cfg_derivator.py - the main python3 source that algorithmically determines a random correct string from a given cfg file,
teatime.cfg - a file containing a context free grammar I made up.

How to run:
python3 random_cfg_derivator.py {cfg filename}
